# Announcements Page

## More drop-in sessions

Quick announcement to say we have some additional TA sessions available starting from next week (see those in bold below):

- Mondays 11-12pm, weeks 2-5 & 7-12 in MVB 4.01 with Kira (weeks 2-5) or John (weeks 7-12)
- **Tuesdays 3-4pm, weeks 3-5 & 7-12 in FRY G.16 with Ali**
- **Wednesdays 4-5pm, weeks 3-5 & 7-12 in FRY G.16 with Nathan**
- Fridays 12-1pm, weeks 1-5, 7-9 & 12 in MVB 4.01 with Alex

This information has now been updated on our Github page as well, in case you'd like a reminder of when/where these sessions are.

To reiterate, these are entirely optional and each in a small room (16-20 person capacity) so do come along if you have specific questions for us, but as first point of call for questions outside of in-person sessions, please do also remember that our Teams channel is available and we have eager TAs specifically keeping an eye, ready to answer your questions!

All the best,
Kira and John

## Another week of Architecture

Week 2 lectures and labsheet are now available on the [unit GitHub page](../#schedule-and-links-to-materials)!

Answers to last week's labsheet as well as links to the recording and padlet from last week's Q&A session have also be uploaded.

As a reminder, tomorrow's workshop is based on last week's materials (so doesn't require you to have looked at anything from week 2 yet) - we'll start off with a live Logisim circuit building session, followed by a formative (does not count towards your unit grade) Blackboard quiz with TA support.

All the best,
Kira and John

## Asking questions and drop-in sessions

For all those asking how they can get some help outside of the labs, in addition to the Teams channel (please post questions!!), we have office hours scheduled for you to come and discuss with us in a small group setting:

- Fridays 12-1pm, in weeks 1-5, 7-9 & 12 in MVB 4.01 with our wonderful lead TA Alex (starting tomorrow!)
- Mondays 11-12pm, weeks 2-5 & 7-12 in MVB 4.01 with Kira (weeks 2-5) or John (weeks 7-12)

These are entirely optional sessions in a small room (that only has a ~20 person capacity) so please do come along if you have specific questions for us, but otherwise the Wednesday Q&A sessions are a great opportunity to ask us lots as well as hear other people's questions!

We plan to have more of these drop-in session on offer soon, so keep an eye out for a further announcement.

All the best,
Kira and John

## Attendance monitoring info error

Hi everyone,
 
It looks like our procedures for monitoring attendance have changed since last year, and we gave out some incorrect information in the intro talk on Tuesday - we won't be using Qwickly, but the University of Bristol app. Sorry about that - we've now put up much more detail on how this works on the unit page [here](
https://cs-uob-overview-of-architecture.github.io/attendance), and removed the old Blackboard subpage which no longer works. If the school office gets in touch asking about non-attendance for week 1, please just blame us!
 
Best wishes,
 
John and Kira

## Welcome!
Welcome to Overview of Computer Architecture!

Week 1 materials are now available on the [unit GitHub page](../#schedule-and-links-to-materials), introducing you to the beginning of digital electronics.

Your first scheduled in-person session with us **(tomorrow) will be an overview of the course** - you don't need to prepare anything in advance for this! However, we do expect that you'll have begun to review this week's materials before Wednesday's Q&A session, where you can bring any content related questions, and that you'll have started to attempt this week's assignment before Thursday's labs. We'll be providing more information on these tomorrow, so please bring any general questions to us then!

For any questions outside of these contact hours; John, our wonderful TAs, and I will be keeping an eye on our [unit's Team page](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3AOSEjrcGJhpxWkwqh7jvjcajSoAqYsCGurNirz1btAfU1%40thread.tacv2/General?groupId=14207547-df04-4db6-8a5d-f1f336aa184d&tenantId=b2e47f30-cd7d-4a4e-a5da-b18cf1a4151b).

All the best,
Kira and John
