## Attendance monitoring info error

Hi everyone,
 
It looks like our procedures for monitoring attendance have changed since last year, and we gave out some incorrect information in the intro talk on Tuesday - we won't be using Qwickly, but the University of Bristol app. Sorry about that - we've now put up much more detail on how this works on the unit page [here](
https://cs-uob-overview-of-architecture.github.io/attendance), and removed the old Blackboard subpage which no longer works. If the school office gets in touch asking about non-attendance for week 1, please just blame us!
 
Best wishes,
 
John and Kira

## Welcome!
Welcome to Overview of Computer Architecture!

Week 1 materials are now available on the [unit GitHub page](../#schedule-and-links-to-materials), introducing you to the beginning of digital electronics.

Your first scheduled in-person session with us **(tomorrow) will be an overview of the course** - you don't need to prepare anything in advance for this! However, we do expect that you'll have begun to review this week's materials before Wednesday's Q&A session, where you can bring any content related questions, and that you'll have started to attempt this week's assignment before Thursday's labs. We'll be providing more information on these tomorrow, so please bring any general questions to us then!

For any questions outside of these contact hours; John, our wonderful TAs, and I will be keeping an eye on our [unit's Team page](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3AOSEjrcGJhpxWkwqh7jvjcajSoAqYsCGurNirz1btAfU1%40thread.tacv2/General?groupId=14207547-df04-4db6-8a5d-f1f336aa184d&tenantId=b2e47f30-cd7d-4a4e-a5da-b18cf1a4151b).
